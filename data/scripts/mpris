# Simple script to read metadata from mpris compatible mediaplayers via dbus.
#
# Run it like this:
# mpris strawberry
#
# The script fills all fields exported by the player's dbusinterface.
# They are defined here: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/metadata/#fields
#
# To see which fields are actually available from your player,
# call something like this from a terminal:
#
# qdbus org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.strawberry /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 Metadata
# or
# qdbus org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.mpv /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 Metadata
# etc.
#
# Every field is available in the data hash 'd' via
# $d{"NAME_OF_FIELD"} (without the 'xesam:' prefix)
# To edit the output just change the marked line accordingly.
